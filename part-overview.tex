\chapter{What is LedgerSMB}
\label{cha-what-is-ledgersmb}

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec-ledgersmb-introduction}
LedgerSMB is an open source, web based \gls{erp}. An \gls{ERP} is a system
which supports business processes of all disciplines throughout the
organization, automating as much of those processes as possible. To
illustrate this, consider the process of selling goods to a customer
in a trade company. Typically, a customer will request a quote, which
Sales will provide. When satisfied he or she will convert the quote
to an order. Sales will register the order, leading to order-pickers
to collect one or more shipments. Upon completion, Finance sends
out an invoice and records the customer's payment. LedgerSMB supports
this process by automating the conversion from quotation to order,
order to shipment and shipment to invoice, as well as providing
pack lists and other production related documents.

LedgerSMB includes a
powerful framework which supports building your own extensions and
integrations with other applications. Through this philosophy, it
aspires to be \emph{the} (open source) integrated administration system.

The software is being developed by the LedgerSMB project with its
homepage at \url{http://ledgersmb.org/}.
However, the actual project activity can be witnessed at the Github
project site hosted at \url{https://github.com/ledgersmb/LedgerSMB} and
on the mailing lists or chat channel 
listed at \url{https://ledgersmb.org/topics/support}

Its open source nature allows you to download LedgerSMB and use it with any
infrastructure you like. So there's no vendor lock-in: you can
always take your data and set up your system with another hardware vendor
or set up your own hardware.

\section{Application architecture}
\label{sec-ledgersmb-architecture}

Due to its heritage from SQL Ledger and the on-going process of rewriting
the inherited code, the architecture differs between parts
of the application: the old parts and the ones which have already been
rewritten.

Overall, the application consists of five layers:

\begin{itemize}
\item The web browser
\item The web server (as a network traffic handler)
\item The web server (as an application - \gls{PSGI})
\item The database (as an application - PL/SQL)
\item The database (as storage)
\end{itemize}

Rewritten parts include the price matrix and the management of customers
and vendors as well as batch payments.

The ``database as an application'' layer is part of the new design, but otherwise
both designs share the same basic structure - as any web application.

As part of the new design, database integrity is being enforced much more
strictly than before.  Much of this enforcement is being done in the database
at the ``storage'' level, by adding constraints to table definitions. Additionally,
the new design moves to a model where a large part of the database API as well
as business logic is implemented in PL/SQL.  The ultimate goal there is to
allow easier development of bindings in languages other than Perl.  Part of this
move is to reduce the \gls{PSGI} layer to become more of a ``glue'' layer between
the web server and the application database layer.

As part of the on-going code restructuring, in 1.4 there will be a \gls{REST} web service
based API for the areas where functionality has been rewritten.

One of the roles that has remained so far for the \gls{PSGI} layer is to generate
\gls{HTML} screens for presentation in the web browser, handling all user interaction.
Recently activities have started to change that for 1.4 and 1.5 to create a
much heavier client in the web browser with back end interaction through
web services.

In the old design everything except storage was handled in the ``web server as an
application (\gls{PSGI})'' layer.


\section{Supported functionality}
\label{sec-ledgersmb-modules}
As most \glspl{erp} LedgerSMB's functionalities are grouped into modules.
Many modules are integrated parts of the base application.  New features
are implemented in separate modules at first to allow evaluation of the
feature set. When a feature set has become sufficiently stable, the new
module will be integrated in the base application. As of that time, the
existing feature set of the module will be frozen, meaning that the utmost
will be done to prevent changes to how the modules operate: to keep them
stable.

These separate modules - which are called \glspl{add-on} - have to be
installed separately. After installation they become seamless parts of
LedgerSMB with no visible difference from the base application. An
additional benefit of having the separation between the base application
and \glspl{add-on} is that it allows for different release schedules
and separate maturity levels.


LedgerSMB \ledgerSMBversion features the following integrated modules:

\begin{itemize}
\item General ledger
\item Payment and Accounts payable
\item Invoicing and Accounts receivable
\item Fixed asset accounting
\item Time registration and invoicing
\item Point of Sale
\item Quotation and Order management
\item Manufacturing
\item Inventory (warehousing) and shipping management
\item VAT reporting (cash based)
\item Controlling
\begin{itemize}
\item Project accounting
\item Department accounting
\end{itemize}
\item Application administration
\end{itemize}

These \glspl{add-on}  can be installed:
\begin{itemize}
\item VAT reporting (accrual based)
\item Enhanced trial-balance report
\item Enhanced recurring transactions
\item Payroll (to be created - under discussion at the time of writing)
\end{itemize}

With this list of modules and \glspl{add-on} LedgerSMB has successfully been implemented
in a wide range of companies of varying types and sizes: shops, manufacturing
companies and service oriented businesses up to as big as four thousand (4.000)
Accounts payable transactions \emph{per week}.

\section{Feature comparison with alternatives}
\label{sec-ledgersmb-feature-comparison}
@@@ TODO

Packages to compare to:

\begin{itemize}
\item GNUcash
\item OSfinancials
\item ERP5
\item OpenERP
\item xTuple
\end{itemize}

\section{Release history}
\label{sec-ledgersmb-release-history}

The project started out as a fork of \gls{SL} - the open source \gls{erp}
developed by Dieter Simader - somewhere between SQL-Ledger versions 2.6
and 2.8.  A fork happens when a group of developers can't - for whatever
reason - continue to work as one group on a project.  At that time, the
project splits into two or more projects and the fork is in effect.

LedgerSMB split off from the SQL-Ledger project (i.e. forked) because
there was disagreement between developers about how to go forward both with
respect to handling of security vulnerability reports as well as the general
state of the code base.

After the fork, between versions 1.0 and 1.2 a lot of energy was spent on
making LedgerSMB more secure (i.e. less vulnerable).  In technical terms,
measures were taken to fend off (amongst other things):

\begin{itemize}
\item Cross site scripting attacks
\item Replay attacks
\item SQL injection attacks
\end{itemize}

Come version 1.3 the development directed toward improvement of the overall
quality of the code base as the old SQL-Ledger code was in very poor state:
looking very much like web scripts as they were written in 1998, the code had
grown largely outdated in style and was no longer maintainable by 2007.

The 1.3 effort focused on bringing relief on that front by introducing
modern structure into the application.  With the new application structure
modern and important features were realized: separation of duties (for the
accounting part of the application) and authorizations to allow distinguishing
different roles in your company.

Unfortunately, by the beginning of 2011 the project looked mostly dead from
an outside perspective: the team had not brought forward any releases since
2007, there were no signs of development activity and the
mailing lists (a measure for community activity) were
completely silent.  \gls{svn} commits were continuing, but were being made by ever
fewer committers and contributors.

Fortunately development activity was increasing in the first half
year of 2011,
leading to the release of version 1.3 by September.  Between September and the
year end in total 10 small bug fixes were released, showing active commitment
of the developers to maintain the application.

New committers showed up, indicating revived community interest. Other signs of
increased interest are the higher number of bug reports and the creation of the
Linux package for Debian 7, which has been included in Ubuntu 12.04 as of
October 2012.



\section{System requirements}
\label{sec-ledgersmb-system-requirements}

The README file which comes with every LedgerSMB software release should be
considered the canonical source for system requirements. In summary, the
following technical components are required:

\begin{itemize}
\item The Apache web server (others may or may not work)
\item Modern Perl 5, with additional modules
\item PostgreSQL 10 or higher, with contribs
\item \LaTeX or XeLaTeX from the TeTeX or TexLive \TeX distributions
\end{itemize}

More information about system requirements is available at

\href{https://ledgersmb.org/content/system-requirements}{https://ledgersmb.org/content/system-requirements} 

Other system requirements such as required RAM and number of CPUs and their speed
largely depend on the expected system activity. However, any modern VPS should
provide enough memory and storage to satisfy a reasonable number of users.

\section{License}
\label{sec-ledgersmb-license}

LedgerSMB is being made available under the terms of the
\textit{GNU Public License version 2}, or shorter \textit{GPLv2}
\footnote{\url{http://www.opensource.org/licenses/GPL-2.0}}.

The project attaches this meaning to the license:
The copyright holders grant you the right to copy and
redistribute the software.  In case you make any modifications to the software
you're obligated to make public those changes.  You are however, free to use
the APIs from your own software without being required to publish your own software.

The project considers the following to be APIs:
\begin{itemize}
\item Database tables
\item URLs with their input and output
\item Webservices of any kind
\item Function and object calls
\end{itemize}

The effect of this interpretation is that changes directly to the code base as
well as inheritance of classes defined in the software constitute ''making modifications''.

\chapter{Reasons to use LedgerSMB}
\label{cha-advocacy}

Jack finds several tools which suit his requirements to some extent or another.
After evaluation of his options he decides to use LedgerSMB for the following reasons:

\begin{itemize}
\item Centralized data storage
\item Actively developed
\item Development team with security focus
\item Access to the application requires only a web browser
\item Integrated sales, shipping, invoicing, purchasing and accounting
\item Open source solution, so no vendor lock in
\item The roadmap appeals to him, because it has web services payrolling on it
\item There are multiple vendors offering commercial support, including hosted options
\item The developers envision building a platform out of it: creating the building blocks
required to build a company on
\end{itemize}


\begin{itemize}
\item Own your own data
\item Freedom to change
        \begin{itemize}
        \item Support organization
        \item Developer (organization)
        \item Data storage provider
        \item Application service provider
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Internal control}
\label{sec-advocacy-internal-control}

Internal control\footnote{See also \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_control}}
helps organizations to prevent and detect fraud by introducing checks and balances
to assess effectiveness and validity of transactions in the organization and thereby
in its \gls{erp} and accounting system(s).

\section{Accounting principles}
\label{sec-system-accounting-principles}

The accounting guidelines \gls{ias} and \gls{ifrs} describe requirements
to financial statements (reports) and the underlying accounting process
\footnote{See also \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Financial_Reporting_Standards}}.
Said requirements include qualitative characteristics:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Relevance
\item Faithful representation
\item Comparability
\item Verifiability
\item Timeliness
\item Understandability
\end{enumerate}

While some - if not most - of these characteristics relate to the process of accounting,
the ``Verifiability'' item clearly has an impact on the underlaying accounting systems:
In order to be verifiable, there must be a clear audit trail to show the origin of the
figures. To make sure users leave behind the required audit trail, some actions can't
be performed in LedgerSMB, even though it would seem to be a logical requirement to be
able to do so - from the perspective of a non-accountant.


\section{Impact of tight integration}
\label{sec-system-impact-of-tight-integration}

While both the qualitative characteristics from \gls{ifrs} and the checks and balances
from the internal controls are pose restrictions on the accounting process,
sometimes these restrictions require support from the underlying accounting
software.

One example is the support for creating reliable audit trails
by protecting accounting data from deletion. It's important to realize the scope
of accounting data in this respect: because invoices are being registered in the
accounts receivable administration - which is summarized in the general ledger -
they are part of the data for which the audit trail needs to be recorded.

Another example is separation of duties (also known as the ``four eye principle''),
where one accountant enters financial transactions and another is responsible for
posting them. This procedure protects the company from an accountant single-handedly
faking transactions and possibly masking fraud.

The requirements for good accounting processes and internal control have impact
on the work flows supported by LedgerSMB. As a consequence some of the work flows
described in part \ref{part-workflows} may seem unwieldy; an example being the
lack of functionality to delete or correct incorrect invoices (See \secref{sec-workflows-invoicing-correction-or-deletion} for more details).



\chapter{Introduction to accounting}
\label{cha-accounting-introduction}

The purpose of an accounting system is to keep track of the company's financial status.

The accounting system has several major parts:
\begin{description}[style=nextline]
        \item [Balance Sheet] A statement of financial position. It provides a snapshot of
        the current financial health of the business by comparing assets, liabilities,
        and equity.  As a snapshot the Balance Sheet is produced for a single given date.
        \item [Income Statement] A statement of income, expenses, and profit/loss.
        Generally, the Income Statement represents a range of time. For example,
        the month of January, the first quarter, the year to date, or a specific year.
        \item [General Journal] Contains the company's transactions.
        \item [General Ledger] Contains the categorized financial data according the chart
        of accounts.
        \item [Chart of Accounts] The categories of financial data which are tracked in
        the financial system. In order to know or report something about your company there
        generally has to be a corresponding category in the Chart of Accounts.
\end{description}

In addition to the parts mentioned above the following terms are used throughout this
document:
\begin{description}[style=nextline]
        \item [Assets] Money and anything that can be converted into money without reducing
        the net equity of the business. Assets include money owed, money held, goods
        available for sale, property, etc.
        \item [Liabilities] Debts owned by the business such as bank loans and unpaid bills.
        \item [Equity] What would be left for the owner if all the assets were converted to
        money and all the liabilities paid off.
        \item [Revenue] Income from business activities.
        \item [Expense] Money paid to operate the business.
        \item [Cost of Goods] Money that is spent to acquire material and services to build a product that is sold.
        \item [Operating Expenses] Expenses that are consumed to administer the business.
        \item [Trial Balance] A report to use when checking that all accounts in the
        General Journal are in balance.
        \item [Accounts Receivable] An asset on the books as a claim for a future payment
        from a customer.
        \item [Accounts Payable] A liability on the books for a future payment to a supplier
        or vendor.
\end{description}

\section{Cash versus accrual basis}
\label{sec-accounting-cash-vs-accrual}

Financial statements, such as the Income Statement and Balance Sheet can be prepared using
either a cash or accrual basis.

In \gls{cash basis} accounting, the income is deemed earned when the business physically
receives the customer payment, and the expenses are deemed incurred when the business
physically pays them. Cash basis accounting does not require the use of purchase orders,
invoices, or long term liabilities.

In \gls{accrual basis} accounting, income is considered earned when a valid asset is
received for services or product provided. The asset is the claim on the customer,
by way of the invoice, to collect an amount at a later date. This asset is called
Accounts Receivable. An expenses is considered earned when a liability is created,
by way of a purchase order, to the supplier or vendor. The liability is the commitment
to pay the supplier or vendor at a later date. This liability is called Accounts Payable.
Accrual basis accounting requires the use of invoices and purchase orders.

There can be a number of problems with \gls{cash basis} accounting:
\begin{itemize}
        \item No visibility in the accounting system regarding your cash commitments leading
        you to think you have more or less money to spend than you actually have.
        \item No visibility in the accounting system about unpaid customer debts.
        \item Your taxing jurisdiction may limit businesses that can use cash basis accounting.
        For example in the United States, if you sell products or services on credit,
        have gross receipts higher that allowed, or need inventory to account for income.
\end{itemize}

\section{Valuation of inventory}
\label{sec-accounting-valuation-inventory}

@@@ TODO Need why is this important paragraph?

The cost of inventory, in theory, includes all costs incurred to acquire the goods and make 
them ready for sale. This theoretical cost may include shipping costs, discounts, insurance, 
receiving costs, handling costs, storage costs, etc.

In practice, the cost used is often limited to the total invoice price for the goods.
This formula may or may not include shipping and handling.
Other costs are often ignored if they are immaterial to the overall cost of the inventory, if there
is no easy way to allocate the costs to the inventory, or they are relatively constant period to period.

Inventory valuation must consider in the following situations:
\begin{itemize}
        \item When the valuation of inventory varies from purchase to purchase. The costing method
        determines the valuation.  This situation is automatically handled in LedgerSMB using one of the
        inventory valuation methods discussed below.
        \item When the valuation of inventory is less that what was paid for it. The inventory must
        be written down. This is usually a manual calculation that is the result of damage, obsolescence, 
        or decline in the vendor or suppliers selling price.
        \item When estimates are required, such as when inventory is stolen, destroyed, or when a physical inventory
        cannot be performed. In this case, a reasonable and consistent manual method must be used to 
        estimate the value. 
\end{itemize}

There are several general automated inventory valuation methods including the following:
\begin{itemize}
        \item Specific Identification -- Each specific inventory item has its cost tracked individually. 
        This method is usually used for large and expensive items that can be tracked by 
        serial number or identification tag. 
        Typically, the specific identification inventory valuation method results an inventory valuation
        close to value of using the \gls{FIFO} method.
        \item \gls{FIFO} -- This method is similar to selling the oldest product first merchandising policy.
        In the \gls{FIFO} method the lastest costs are included in inventory cost and the older costs
        are charged back to \gls{COGS}.

        \gls{FIFO} is the preferred method for maintaining accurate historical costs and is less 
        susceptible to income manipulation by the timing of new purchases. Typically \gls{FIFO}
        results in the highest inventory value of these methods.
        
        % https://github.com/ledgersmb/LedgerSMB/blob/master/sql/modules/COGS.sql
        In LedgerSMB the inventory cost is tracked on a \gls{FIFO} basis. When a part is purchased, 
        its cost is added to the inventory asset account. When the part is sold, the cost of the item
        is moved to the cost of goods sold account.\\
        @@@TODO Is this paragraph redundant?\\
        @@@TODO  What sold cost is used; oldest, newest, average?\\
        @@@TODO How is the inventory asset account debited?
        \item \gls{LIFO} --  Under \gls{LIFO} the costs of the last goods purchased are charged
        against revenues as the \gls{COGS} and the inventory is composed of the costs
        of the oldest goods acquired.
        
        \gls{LIFO} is preferred when prices are rising as it typically results in reducing net income and
        thereby reducing taxes. However, \gls{LIFO} allows manipulation of income by simply changing the time
        at which additional purchases are made and does not represent accurate historical costs. 
        Typically \gls{LIFO} results in the lowest inventory value.
        
        \item Weighted Average -- Under the weighted average method, the total number of units 
        purchased plus those on-hand at the beginning of the period is divided by the total costs
        of purchases plus the cost of the beginning inventory.
        
        Typically the weighted average inventory valuation method results in 
        an inventory value between \gls{FIFO}, which is the highest,
        and \gls{LIFO} which is the lowest.
\end{itemize}
