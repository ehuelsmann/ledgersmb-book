\section*{Preface}
\label{preface}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Preface}

The current development goal for the book is to get the content current and accurate,
not necessarily perfect structure and grammar.

You will find many incomplete sections which should be regarded as an outline for the finished book.
However, some sections are nearly complete.

Because LedgerSMB is undergoing active infrastructure and API changes in 2023, some portions of this book will not be written until those changes are nearing completion.

\section*{Intended audience}
\label{sec-intended-audience}

The book has been split up into several parts intended for starting entrepreneurs,
(potential) users, application integration developers and
administrators, it offers something for everybody who works with or considers working with
LedgerSMB.

\section*{Organization of the book}
\label{sec-book-organization}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Organization of the book}

The first
part (\lq\hyperref[part-overview]{Overview}\rq) is intended for everybody who tries to get an impression of LedgerSMB, with
chapters on technology, features, licensing and a bit of project history.

The second part
(\lq\hyperref[part-getting-started]{Getting started}\rq) leads new users and especially new entrepreneurs step by step through the
application using a tutorial format. This part also contains additional explanations on good business and accounting
processes.

The third part (\lq\hyperref[part-configuration]{Configuration}\rq) describes system wide configuration settings such as
the LedgerSMB configuration file and those required for dependencies like PostgreSQL. Additionally
it describes the company specific settings within the application, such as audit control settings
and required special accounts. This part is required material for anybody who wants to set up
a LedgerSMB instance.

The fourth part (\lq\hyperref[part-administration]{Administration}\rq) discusses the different topics
regarding application administration such as user management, product definition, taxes and etc.
Anybody responsible for maintaining application instances in good health should read this part.

The fifth part (\lq\hyperref[part-business-processes]{Business processes}\rq) discusses LedgerSMB's best practices. 
This part is highly advised
reading for everybody who is a LedgerSMB user and should be considered required reading for 'business
architects': those in the company who decide about process design and execution.

The sixth part (\lq\hyperref[part-customization]{Customization}\rq) discusses how to customize the application. 
This part is intended for developers of
custom extensions (such as company specific integrations), add-ons and plug-ins.

The last part (\lq\hyperref[part-appendices]{Appendices}\lq) contain supplemental reference information on various subjects, 
such as a listing and description
of the authorization roles in the application as well as information on migration to or upgrading of
LedgerSMB versions.
