\chapter{Customers and vendors}

\section{Introduction}

In order to understand how to use customers and vendors, this section describes
how LedgerSMB implements these concepts.

When creating a customer or vendor in LedgerSMB, you have to create a company
\footnote{The LedgerSMB database model allows much more flexible constructs
involving humans as well as companies or legal entities, but this chapter discusses
the web interface exposed functionality only.}. However,
this company can't itself be used as a one. Instead, you have to create an ``account''
\footnote{These ``accounts'' are referred to as (entity) credit accounts as well as
customers or vendors.}
which is linked to the company. An account can have either the role of vendor or customer.
Due to this construct, a single company can both be vendor and customer which is
sometimes desirable.

One company can have multiple customer and/or vendor type accounts. Each account has its
own language settings, shipping address, contact data and payment conditions.
Basically, you will create multiple accounts when you have to record different data
for any of the items listed above.

The company itself is used - albeit not as customer or vendor - in the context of
credit risk management (See \charef{cha:credit-risk-management}).

\section{Creating customers and vendors}
\label{sec:creating-customers-and-vendors}

The procedure to create customers and vendors works exactly alike:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Creation of a company
\item Creation of a credit entity account (''account'')
\item Attaching addresses, contact info and notes to the account 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Creation of a company}

A company has the following fields:

\begin{description}
\item [Control code] Code to uniquely identify the company
\item [Name] Legal name of the company
\item [Country] Country of incorporation
\item [Tax number] Tax (VAT/Sales tax) number of the company
\item [SIC (Standized Industry Code)] Code used to identify
    the type of business of the company
\end{description}

The ``Generate Control code'' button generates a new control code upon
user request when the user is entering a company which isn't yet known
in the system in any other role.

The ``Retrieve'' button is discussed in \secref{sec:VendorsFromCustomers}.


\subsection{Creating an account}
\label{subsec:customers-creating-account}

When a company of class ``Customer'' or ``Vendor'' has been created,
accounts of that type can be added. The account entry screen lists the
following fields:

\begin{description}
\item [Customer number] Number to identify this account among all other accounts in the company;
     when left empty, the system will generate one when you click ``Save New''
\item [Description] Textual representation of the account, usually a name
\item [Pay To] % @@@ ### What's this?
\item [Starting Date] Date from which the account is valid
\item [End date] Date until which the account is valid
\item [Credit limit] Maximum amount of open invoices allowed for the account, see
    \charef{cha:credit-risk-management}
\item [Terms] Number of days within which invoices have to be paid
\item [Discount (conditions)] Percentage discount the account is entitled to when payment
         is within the given number of days
\item [Subcontract GIFI] % @@@ ### What's this??
\item [AR (account)] Account to post created invoices on
\item [Payment (account)] Account used as default to accept payments on
\item [Discount (account)] Account used to post discounts as calculated based on discount conditions
\item [Business Type] Deprecated. Should not be used anymore.
\item [Threshold] % @@@ ### What's this??
\item [Pricegroup] Deprecated. Replaced by price matrix functionality.
% ### TODO: Aren't pricegroups part of the price matrix functionality??
\item [Taxforms] % @@@ ### What's this??
\item [Language] The language parameter is used to select templates for communication with the customer
\item [Currency] The (default) currency to be used with the customer

\chapter{Sales and vendor orders}
\label{cha:OrderManagement}

In this chapter the options for creating orders will be discussed.
After successful order creation, there are two possible next steps.
The first applies to cases where actual goods have to be handled
and goes through shipping and receiving as discussed in
\charef{cha:InventoryManagement}. The other skips handling of goods
and directly proceeds to invoicing in \charef{cha:Invoicing}.

\section{Incomplete orders}

Orders fully shipped and invoiced are automatically closed. However, this isn't always an option.

In case an order ends up being partially shipped and parties agree not to ship the remaining
items in the order, the order stays open and incomplete. In situations like these, the order
needs to be marked ``Closed'' in the order entry screen. A note stating why the order was manually
closed can be put in the ``Internal Notes'' input box. Clicking the ``Save'' button stores the
changes in the application database.

\section{Receiving}
\label{sec:Receiving}

% ### TODO the role of shipping points in receipts??

Reception of goods into inventory assumes having at least one
saved and incomplete purchase order such as shown in
\figref{fig:purchase-order-screen} stored in the system.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=7cm]{purchase-order-screen.png}
\caption{Saved purchase order}
\label{fig:purchase-order-screen}
\end{figure}

The reception process starts by going through the menu to the
``Receive'' order lookup screen (Shipping $\rightarrow$ Receive).
This will show the order search screen which will help finding
any orders which have items available for reception, see \figref{fig:shipping-receive-search-screen}.


\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=7cm]{shipping-receive-search-screen.png}
\caption{Search screen for purchase order item receipts}
\label{fig:shipping-receive-search-screen}
\end{figure}

After filling order selection criteria and hitting the ``Continue'' button (or doing so
immediately to see all orders with outstanding items in the system), the system will return
a listing of orders with matching the selection criteria as in \figref{fig:shipping-receive-search-result-screen}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=7cm]{shipping-receive-search-result-screen.png}
\caption{Search results screen for purchase order item receipts}
\label{fig:shipping-receive-search-result-screen}
\end{figure}

Upon selection of one of the orders by clicking the order number the next screen is loaded
as shown in \figref{fig:shipping-receive-screen}. In this screen you can enter the amounts
received in the current lot. The entered data is to be confirmed with the ``Done'' button.
After confirmation of the receipt screen, items will be added to inventory.

\begin{figure}[h]

\includegraphics[width=7cm]{shipping-receive-screen.png}
\caption{Purchase order receipt screen}
\label{fig:shipping-receive-screen}
\end{figure}

LedgerSMB supports warehouse management on the Receipt screen by offering the ability to
print a ``Bin List''. This list contains the bin (storage) locations configured for each part.


\section{Partial shipments}

Both shipping and receiving support partial shipments and per-lot invoicing. If the vendor
ships multiple lots to a single order (and charges a single invoice), you can simply call
up the order and enter items into inventory on the same order. The outstanding items
are automatically decremented by the amounts entered before.

To create an invoice for a received lot simply follow the process as detailed in
\secref{sec:InvoicesFromOrders}. If the lot is a partial shipment, the invoice will be
for the current receipt by default.

\chapter{Sales and vendor invoices}
\label{cha:Invoicing}

Invoices can come from multiple sources. When the quotation and order
management functionalities in LedgerSMB aren't used, they will usually
be entered manually. This work flow is covered in Section
\ref{sec:ManuallyCreatingInvoices}.
When order management \emph{is} being used they mostly originate from orders
which is covered in Section \ref{sec:InvoicesFromOrders}.



\section{Creating invoices from orders}
\label{sec:InvoicesFromOrders}

% This section first because the previous chapter is about orders,
% which seems like a natural flow for the book




\section{Creating new invoices}
\label{sec:ManuallyCreatingInvoices}


%% this section is about Sales and Vendor Invoices

When a business decides not to use the order management as per the previous
chapter it may find itself in need to manually enter invoices. But even
if it does use order management, it may be necessary to enter an invoice
directly.

When creating a transaction to record that the company owes another
entity (a vendor invoice) or that it has outstanding receivables,
LedgerSMB offers two options:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Invoices
\item Transactions
\end{enumerate}

Transactions have very limited functionality: they allow a user to enter
a debt owed or owned into the AR and AP subsystems. They also require the
user to think how the other side of the transaction should be registered;
i.e. which cost account the AP transaction should be posted against, or
which income account the AR transaction should be posted against. If there
are sales taxes applicable, the user is required to manually calculate and
enter them.

Invoices offer a much more clever set of functionalities. First of all, it
allows the user to create a document to be sent to the vendor or customer.
Second, invoices take advantage of parts and services
to automate calculation of sales taxes. Third, invoices update inventory
for items held in stock (parts, assemblies). Transactions offer none of this.

\subsection{Invoices}
\label{subsec:creating-invoices}
As mentioned in the previous paragraph, invoices can perform automatic
sales tax calculations, maintain inventory and post income (or expense)
to the correct GL accounts.

To be able to do so, they need the items on the invoice to be correctly
configured. See \charef{cha:ProductsDefinition} how to set up products
and services.

% @@@ Invoice entry screen screenshot(s)

\subsection{Transactions}

Transactions serve an important purpose not handled by invoices: payroll
calculations are often too difficult to fit in the simple ``amount times price''
model offered by invoices. In order to still be able to track which ``vendor''
was paid which amount such payment obligations can be recorded in the AP subsystem
with a transaction.

Likewise it's often more hassle than it's worth to create the parts and services
required to correctly calculate the utility bill. In such cases the transaction
(possibly with a linked document as supporting evidence) offers good per-vendor
traceable history records.

% @@@ Transaction creation screen shot(s)

\section{Recurring invoices}



\section{Invalidating invoices}

Sometimes, it's necessary to invalidate an invoice. When an invoice has been
posted, this also means derived administrations have been updated, such as
inventory for the items on the invoice.

To undo the effects of an invoice, i.e. to reduce the amount outstanding with a
customer, use the \texttt{VOID} button on the invoice screen as shown in @@@figref .
This creates a new invoice by the same number as the original, except that the new
invoice has a suffix \texttt{-VOID}.

\begin{quotation}
Unfortunately, in LedgerSMB 1.3 - the earlier versions - voiding an invoice did not
automatically close the original and voiding invoices.  To close both invoices from
the open invoice overview, use the cash receipt process as described in
\secref{sec:SinglePayments} to make a zero amount payment.
\end{quotation}

\section{Correcting and deleting invoices}
\label{sec:CorrectingInvoices}

There's only one way to persist an invoice in LedgerSMB: posting it. This means
the invoice becomes part of the accounting information. One of the primary
properties of an accounting system is to record full audit trails and help enforce
internal controls as detailed in \secref{sec:AccountingSystemRequirements}. Because
of that fact there's no way to delete or edit invoices after they have been posted
\footnote{LedgerSMB currently does not support saving an invoice without posting
it. This functionality is on the roadmap for addition when the AR/AP functionality
is being rewritten - currently 1.5 or 1.6.}.

The only way to ``undo'' an invoice is by voiding it. This is important for several
reasons:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Invoices can't be deleted (because they're accounting data)
\item Invoices pose a claim on the assets of a customer
\label{item:InvoicesAsClaims}
\item @@@ others?
\end{enumerate}

Specifically item \ref{item:InvoicesAsClaims} is important: when you sent the invoice
to your customer, you effectively sent them a claim. When you decide to refrain from
pursuing that claim, you should notify them of that fact so they have the documentation
to update their accounting system to reflect that fact: they need your documentation
to void their vendor invoice, instead of paying it.

For the same reason it's ill-advised (and no longer supported) to edit invoices:
when a customer has multiple invoices, each stating a different amount, all
using the same invoice number; how is that customer supposed to document (verifiably)
that the claim has been settled satisfactorily by paying the one he did?

See the Remarks section at the end of this chapter for details on how to handle
the draft invoice requirement.

\section{Handling invoice disputes}

%When an invoice has been sent to a customer it could happen that the customer disagrees
%with the invoice due to incorrect amounts, discounts, products, etc.
%
%Depending on whether the customer has already paid the invoice there are several
%options to handle this situation:

\section{Remarks}

\begin{description}
\item [Why can't I send a draft invoice to a customer and edit it
   to match their expectations?] 
You can't edit invoices any more in LedgerSMB 1.3 because it breaks the audit trail
in financial accounting. But in fact there's functionality available which is meant
exactly for this purpose. It's called ``Sales order'' and its details are in
\charef{cha:OrderManagement}. Sales orders can be converted - upon customer approval -
into an invoice with a click of a button.

\chapter{Credit risk management}
\label{cha:credit-risk-management}

\section{Introduction}

A company runs credit risk when it gives credit: it runs the risk of the
creditor not paying off its debts.  LedgerSMB features two ways to manage
the risks involved:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Limit management
\item Arrears management
\end{enumerate}

The former tries to limit the risk involved by making sure no customer
receives more credit than a certain limit while the latter tries to
make sure any over due payments get cashed.

\section{Limit management}

Limit management should prevent a company on one hand from delivering too much
to its customers at once and on the other from taking (and delivering) new orders
to customers with too high amount of unpaid invoices.

@@@ Where to set up limits

@@@ How to monitor limits

\section{Granting payment terms}

\section{Managing arrears}

As mentioned before, the process of managing arrears is directed toward
detecting arrears positions with customers early and taking appropriate
action.


\subsection{Monitoring AR aging}

In order to find out about over due invoices, a company should run the AR
aging report available under AR $\rightarrow$ Reports $\rightarrow$ AR Aging.
The initial screen presents parameters for the aging report to be generated.

@@@ discuss parameters

This report shows customers and their outstanding invoices categorised as:

\begin{description}
\item [Current] Invoices not over due
\item [30] Invoice amounts over due by 30 days or less
\item [60] Invoice amounts over due by 60 days or less (but more than 30)
\item [90] Invoice amounts over due by 90 days or less (but more than 60)
\end{description}


@@@ Printing / mailing aging reports to customers


\subsection{Tracking invoice history}

After an invoice becomes over due a process will be started to remind
the customer of the outstanding amount requiring payment.

In order to keep records of actions taken to chase customer payment,
the invoice screen has an ``Internal Notes'' field which can be edited
after the invoice has been posted.

In order to save any edits to that field, hit the ``Save Info'' button.

\begin{quotation}
Note that the ``Save Info'' button also saves any changes to the ``TaxForm'' column or
rather, any information that's not accounting information (posted to the books and
thereby fixed) nor information which appears on the invoice - which also should remain
unedited in order to be able to generate an exact copy at a later date.
\end{quotation}


\subsection{Special treatment of invoices}

There may be good reasons to treat some over due invoices differently. E.g. in case
payment arrangements have been made with the customer and further standard arrears
management would not be appropriate any more.

In this case, you can put an invoice ``On Hold''. The opposite of being on hold is
being active. The AR Aging report allows selection of all invoices, only active
invoices (those not on hold) or only invoices on hold.

\section{Period closing}

Period closing is a concept used by accountants to ensure that audited and
known-correct accounting data stays correct by ``freezing'' it: by closing
an accounting period no modifications can be made to the accounting data
before a certain date.

LedgerSMB supports this concept through the System $\rightarrow$ Audit Control
menu, where you'll find the ``Close Books up to'' item. By filling out a date
in the input field and hitting Continue posting to dates before the entered
date will be disallowed.

% @@@ screenshot

\begin{quotation}
Note that due to a design limitation in LedgerSMB 1.3 - to be lifted with the
general AR/AP redesign - invoices in foreign currencies can't be reversed on
other dates than their original posting date. That is: they can, but their
reversal will result in P\&L and balance sheet effects which presumably isn't
desirable. Since period closing disables posting before a certain date this
functionality may have negative side effects in some set ups.

Also note that this pertains exclusively to invoices and transactions in foreign
currencies and has no effect in case of invoices and transactions in the default
currency.
\end{quotation}

\section{Year-end processing}
\label{sec:YearEndProcessing}

Year end closing is a concept which prepares the accounting books for the next
accounting year. Note that this is unrelated to the calendar year but to the
accounting year of the company instead. To muddy the waters even more: there's
no inherent requirement for this process to be run at least once a year. If the
first book year of the company spans more than a year, then this procedure will
be run more than a year after starting up the company.

This procedure freezes the accounting data in the year to be closed as described
in the previous section. Additionally it clears out the profit and loss accounts:
setting all the account
balances to zero by posting their balance to the retained earnings account. Some
businesses prefer to create a retained earnings account for each book year they
close. LedgerSMB supports that use-case by allowing the user to select which
retained earnings account the balance should be posted to.

Some companies want may to include additional transactions related to dividend
payment regarding the current year: reduce the equity by the amount paid as
dividends in transactions marked as ``year-end transaction''. Support
for this use case isn't available in LedgerSMB 1.3.

% @@@ screenshot

\section{Entering general accounting documents}

Even though the application handles many general ledger postings as consequences
from work flows elsewhere in the system - thus not requiring separate postings -
sometimes the need may occur to create manual postings not resulting from
AR or AP transactions or till and inventory adjustments.

One example of a case like that is the calculation, and posting of
corporate taxes presumably at the end of each accounting period but at least
at the end of the book year.
