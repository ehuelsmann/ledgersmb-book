\section{Introduction}

This part of the book will run the reader through the LedgerSMB using an example
startup company run by Jack: JaCo Inc, which starts its life as a computer parts
store for the business to business market.

Jack just completed incorporation of JaCo and is ready to start doing business.
Before starting his operation Jack decides to look for tooling to run his operation
efficiently.

The other chapters in this part of the book show you what steps Jack has to go through
to get LedgerSMB up and running for JaCo, but also which steps he has to take to
keep LedgerSMB in good health.

Due to its success JaCo will grow, posing new challenges to LedgerSMB and we'll show
you how Jack can change the configuration to allow LedgerSMB to grow with his business.

It's outside the scope of this part to explain how to install the application. See
Part \ref{part:Configuration} for information on installation. \refcha{cha:CompanyCreation}
starts when the software has been installed yet nothing more has been done.

After evaluation of his options he decides to use LedgerSMB for the following reasons:

\item Development team with security focus
\item Access to the application requires only a web browser
\item Integrated sales, shipping, invoicing, purchasing and accounting
\item Open source solution, so no vendor lock in
\item @@@ others?
\end{itemize}
