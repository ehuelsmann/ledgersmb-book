\chapter{Sales and vendor invoices}

Invoices can come from multiple sources. When the quotation and order
management functionalities in LedgerSMB aren't used, they will usually
be entered manually. This work flow is covered in Section
\ref{sec:ManuallyCreatingInvoices}.
When order management \emph{is} being used they mostly originate from orders
which is covered in Section \ref{sec:InvoicesFromOrders}.


\section{Creating new invoices}
\label{sec:ManuallyCreatingInvoices}


%% this section is about Sales and Vendor Invoices

When creating a transaction to record that the company owes another
entity (a vendor invoice) or that it has outstanding receivables,
LedgerSMB offers two options:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Invoices
\item Transactions
\end{enumerate}

Transactions have very limited functionality: they allow a user to enter
a debt owed or owned into the AR and AP subsystems. They also require the
user to think how the other side of the transaction should be registered;
i.e. which cost account the AP transaction should be posted against, or
which income account the AR transaction should be posted against. If there
are sales taxes applicable, the user is required to manually calculate and
enter them.

Invoices offer a much more clever set of functionalities. First of all, it
allows the user to create a document to be sent to the vendor or customer.
Second, invoices take advantage of parts and services
to automate calculation of sales taxes. Third, invoices update inventory
for items held in stock (parts, assemblies). Transactions offer none of this.

\subsection{Invoices}



\subsection{Transactions}

Transactions serve an important purpose not handled by invoices: payroll
calculations are often too difficult to fit in the simple ``amount times price''
model offered by invoices. In order to still be able to track which ``vendor''
was paid which amount such payment obligations can be recorded in the AP subsystem
with a transaction.

Likewise it's often more hassle than it's worth to create the parts and services
required to correctly calculate the utility bill. In such cases the transaction
(possibly with a linked document as supporting evidence) offers good per-vendor
trackable history records.

\section{Creating invoices from orders}
\label{sec:InvoicesFromOrders}


\section{Invalidating invoices}

Sometimes, it's necessary to invalidate an invoice. When an invoice has been
posted, this also means derived administrations have been updated, such as
inventory for the items on the invoice.

To undo the effects of an invoice, i.e. to reduce the amount outstanding with a
customer, use the \texttt{VOID} button on the invoice screen as shown in @@@figref .
This creates a new invoice by the same number as the original, except that the new
invoice has a suffix \texttt{-VOID}.

\begin{quotation}
Unfortunately, in LedgerSMB 1.3 - the earlier versions - voiding an invoice did not
automatically close the original and voiding invoices.  To close both invoices from
the open invoice overview, use the cash receipt process as described in
\secref{sec:SinglePayments} to make a zero amount payment.
\end{quotation}

\section{Correcting and deleting invoices}
\label{sec:CorrectingInvoices}

There's only one way to persist an invoice in LedgerSMB: posting it. This means
the invoice becomes part of the accounting information. One of the primary
properties of an accounting system is to record full audit trails and help enforce
internal controls as detailed in \secref{sec:AccountingSystemRequirements}. Because
of that fact there's no way to delete or edit invoices after they have been posted
\footnote{LedgerSMB currently does not support saving an invoice without posting
it. This functionality is on the roadmap for addition when the AR/AP functionality
is being rewritten - currently 1.5 or 1.6.}.

The only way to ``undo'' an invoice is by voiding it. This is important for several
reasons:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Invoices can't be deleted (because they're accounting data)
\item Invoices pose a claim on the assets of a customer
\label{item:InvoicesAsClaims}
\item @@@ others?
\end{enumerate}

Specifically item \ref{item:InvoicesAsClaims} is important: when you sent the invoice
to your customer, you effectively sent them a claim. When you decide to refrain from
pursuing that claim, you should notify them of that fact so they have the documentation
to update their accounting system to reflect that fact: they need your documentation
to void their vendor invoice, instead of paying it.

For the same reason it's ill-advised (and no longer supported) to edit invoices:
when a customer has multiple invoices, each stating a different amount, all
using the same invoice number; how is that customer supposed to document (verifiably)
that the claim has been settled satisfactorily by paying the one he did?

\section{Handling invoice disputes}

%When an invoice has been sent to a customer it could happen that the customer disagrees
%with the invoice due to incorrect amounts, discounts, products, etc.
%
%Depending on whether the customer has already paid the invoice there are several
%options to handle this situation:
%
%@@@ AR Invoices have nothing to do with it! They parallel AR Transactions!!
%
%\begin{description}
%\item [Credit invoices] The customer has not paid the invoice yet
%\item [Credit notes] The customer has paid the invoice and allows offsetting against
%   other (possibly future) invoices
%\item[AR vouchers] The customer has paid the invoice and demands repayment
%\end{description}
%
%Note that the naming in the listing above applies to AR items but could equally apply
%to AP items by replacing the word ``Credit'' by ``Debit'' and ``AR'' by ``AP''.

\chapter{Credit risk management}

\section{Introduction}

A company runs credit risk when it gives credit: it runs the risk of the
creditor not paying off its debts.  LedgerSMB features two ways to manage
the risks involved:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Limit management
\item Arrears management
\end{enumerate}

The former tries to limit the risk involved by making sure no customer
receives more credit than a certain limit while the latter tries to
make sure any over due payments get cashed.

\section{Limit management}

Limit management should prevent a company on one hand from delivering too much
to its customers at once and on the other from taking (and delivering) new orders
to customers with too high amount of unpaid invoices.

@@@ Where to set up limits

@@@ How to monitor limits


\section{Managing arrears}

As mentioned before, the process of managing arrears is directed toward
detecting arrears positions with customers early and taking appropriate
action.


\subsection{Monitoring AR aging}

In order to find out about over due invoices, a company should run the AR
aging report available under AR $\rightarrow$ Reports $\rightarrow$ AR Aging.
The initial screen presents parameters for the aging report to be generated.

@@@ discuss parameters

This report shows customers and their outstanding invoices categorised as:

\begin{description}
\item [Current] Invoices not over due
\item [30] Invoice amounts over due by 30 days or less
\item [60] Invoice amounts over due by 60 days or less (but more than 30)
\item [90] Invoice amounts over due by 90 days or less (but more than 60)
\end{description}


@@@ Printing / mailing aging reports to customers


\subsection{Tracking invoice history}

After an invoice becomes over due a process will be started to remind
the customer of the outstanding amount requiring payment.

In order to keep records of actions taken to chase customer payment,
the invoice screen has an ``Internal Notes'' field which can be edited
after the invoice has been posted.

In order to save any edits to that field, hit the ``Save Info'' button.

\begin{quotation}
Note that the ``Save Info'' button also saves any changes to the ``TaxForm'' column or
rather, any information that's not accounting information (posted to the books and
thereby fixed) nor information which appears on the invoice - which also should remain
unedited in order to be able to generate an exact copy at a later date.
\end{quotation}


\subsection{Special treatment of invoices}

There may be good reasons to treat some over due invoices differently. E.g. in case
payment arrangements have been made with the customer and further standard arrears
management would not be appropriate any more.

In this case, you can put an invoice ``On Hold''. The opposite of being on hold is
being active. The AR Aging report allows selection of all invoices, only active
invoices (those not on hold) or only invoices on hold.
