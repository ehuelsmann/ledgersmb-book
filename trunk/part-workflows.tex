\section{Invalidating invoices}

Sometimes, it's necessary to invalidate an invoice. When an invoice has been
posted, this also means derived administrations have been updated, such as
inventory for the items on the invoice.

To undo the effects of an invoice, i.e. to reduce the amount outstanding with a
customer, use the \texttt{VOID} button on the invoice screen as shown in @@@figref .
This creates a new invoice by the same number as the original, except that the new
invoice has a suffix \texttt{-VOID}.

\begin{quotation}
Unfortunately, in LedgerSMB 1.3 - the earlier versions - voiding an invoice did not
automatically close the original and voiding invoices.  To close both invoices from
the open invoice overview, use the cash receipt process as described in
\secref{sec:SinglePayments} to make a zero amount payment.

\chapter{Credit risk management}

\section{Introduction}

A company runs credit risk when it gives credit: it runs the risk of the
creditor not paying off its debts.  LedgerSMB features two ways to manage
the risks involved:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Limit management
\item Arrears management
\end{enumerate}

The former tries to limit the risk involved by making sure no customer
receives more credit than a certain limit while the latter tries to
make sure any over due payments get cashed.

\section{Limit management}

Limit management should prevent a company on one hand from delivering too much
to its customers at once and on the other from taking (and delivering) new orders
to customers with too high amount of unpaid invoices.

@@@ How to monitor limits


\section{Managing arrears}

As mentioned before, the process of managing arrears is directed toward
detecting arrears positions with customers early and taking appropriate
action.


\subsection{Monitoring AR aging}

In order to find out about over due invoices, a company should run the AR
aging report available under AR $\rightarrow$ Reports $\rightarrow$ AR Aging.
The initial screen presents parameters for the aging report to be generated.

@@@ discuss parameters

This report shows customers and their outstanding invoices categorised as:

\begin{description}
\item [Current] Invoices not over due
\item [30] Invoice amounts over due by 30 days or less
\item [60] Invoice amounts over due by 60 days or less (but more than 30)
\item [90] Invoice amounts over due by 90 days or less (but more than 60)
\end{description}


@@@ Printing / mailing aging reports to customers


\subsection{Tracking invoice history}

After an invoice becomes over due a process will be started to remind
the customer of the outstanding amount requiring payment.

In order to keep records of actions taken to chase customer payment,
the invoice screen has an ``Internal Notes'' field which can be edited
after the invoice has been posted.

In order to save any edits to that field, hit the ``Save Info'' button.

\begin{quotation}
Note that the ``Save Info'' button also saves any changes to the ``TaxForm'' column or
rather, any information that's not accounting information (posted to the books and
thereby fixed) nor information which appears on the invoice - which also should remain
unedited in order to be able to generate an exact copy at a later date.
\end{quotation}


\subsection{Special treatment of invoices}

There may be good reasons to treat some over due invoices differently. E.g. in case
payment arrangements have been made with the customer and further standard arrears
management would not be appropriate any more.

In this case, you can put an invoice ``On Hold''. The opposite of being on hold is
being active. The AR Aging report allows selection of all invoices, only active
invoices (those not on hold) or only invoices on hold.
